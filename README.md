# Dev Container Features Playground

This repo is my place for experimenting with [dev container features](https://containers.dev/features).

Features in this repo are likely to change/break/disappear as I explore ideas. When I'm happy with a feature, I will move it to [stuartleeks/dev-container-features](https://github.com/stuartleeks/dev-container-features).

If you want to create your own features, see <https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-template>


| Feature                                    | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [shell-history](src/shell-history/README.md) | Preserve shell history across dev container instances/rebuilds |
| [bash-history](src/bash-history/README.md) | (Precursor to shell-history) Preserve bash history across dev container instances/rebuilds |
